Hello, my name is Michael Swanbeck, and to me, life is a grand adventure. I'm starting this blog to document the journey which is about to unfold for me, for in October I'm taking off to see the world. Not sure where exactly I'm going to go, or where it will start, but I'm trying to get to New Zealand eventually.

At some point in my life I became obsessed with looking at photos on the internet. Photos of places, accompanied by maps, exotic names, bright colors, mountains. So many places far from my home in Massachusetts stuck themselves in my mind as destinations I wanted to see. Places like Alaska, Tahiti, Iceland, Costa Rica, Utah, the list goes on... I realized at some point I would have no choice but to go to these places, but I also realized there are too many places in this world to see in just one lifetime. I better get going then!

In school I learned culinary arts, and have been using my trade to work cooking jobs wherever I travel. In 2013 I found a job working in Montana's Glacier national park, at the Many Glacier hotel for four months of the summer. I put a cap on the back of my truck and built myself a bed in it, my new home, and took off cross-country. Today, that was two years ago, I left home with no idea when I would be back. "See America First" was their slogan, so that's precisely what I decided to do. The summer there changed my life, so much happened in so little time. It was there I met Maggie, who traveled with me as a faithful companion.

Being surrounded by mountains and beauty all the time, I would find I appreciated beauty more and more. The truths I found from the wilderness were absolute. To be close to nature is to be connected to whatever force it is which created us, some call it God, and the feeling of being close with this force is sublime. Many things in life are sublime. I decided I wanted to spend my life focused on "Seeking the Sublime" (that's the title of the book I'm writing about these two years in America). Material possessions could never fulfill me as much as being free out there to simply see and appreciate the world.

<a href="http://www.swanbeck.net/7minutestothetop/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GLASHA.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-46" src="http://www.swanbeck.net/7minutestothetop/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GLASHA.jpg" alt="GLASHA" width="600" height="450" /></a>

I'm writing about it for many reason. I love writing, it's therapeutic. I hope someday to be able to make enough money from writing that I can stop cooking in restaurants! Finally, I want to bring the reader to these places with me, give something back to the world, and share the beauty of the sublime with the rest of us who might not know it.

So anyway, I left Glacier in September and went to Utah, from there I found my way to California. Maggie broke her leg and we were separated. I wound up working a fantastic job in Death Valley and when Maggie healed she came out there to meet me. The two of us took off from Death Valley in May and went all over the west, spending two months living in the truck. Finally we met my father in Washington state where he took the truck and drove it home, and Maggie and I set off on a southbound hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. We had the trip of a lifetime living out of our backpacks for three and a half months, hiking on average 17 miles every day. The trip ended abruptly just south of Death Valley, so we basically made a 6 month loop of a journey to bring us back to this quiet, enchanting place. I spent the winter again working in my desert home, but even though Maggie and I loved each other deeply, we went our separate ways. I spent the winter writing the book, and now I'm home in New England getting ready to try and publish it.

Even though nine months have passed since Maggie and I have been together, she is still with me in spirit. This next trip I will start alone, but who knows, maybe she will find me out there someday. Thank you for reading.
